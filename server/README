This document describes how to configure a factory diagnostic server.

To proceed you must be familiar with linux command line operation and common
utilities.

The server you select should have at least 512GB server-grade hard disk and two
gigabit ethernet interfaces. It may run for months or years without direct
supervision, so quality hardware is important. However system performance is
NOT important, the server does not require high-end graphics or large amounts
of memory. Any low-end rack mount server from Dell with a server-grade hard
disk will be fine.

If the server supports hardware RAID 1 you may need to enable it in system
BIOS, not in scope of this document. Bear in mind that it may not be possible
for linux to monitor the health of a hardware raid array.

If BIOS shows memory allocated for GPU it can be set to the minimum possible
size.

One of the network interfaces will be the "factory" interface, attached to the
factory LAN.  The other will be the "dut" interface, attached (via a switch) to
the test stations. The server acts as the gateway for the dut network,
providing DHCP, DNS, and NAT.

The server runs Debian Linux. 

Start by downloading the ISO install image from 
https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/9.9.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.9.0-amd64-netinst.iso
(later distributions have not been tested).

Assuming the server can boot from USB, dd the image onto a USB stick.
(Otherwise you'll have to create a CD/DVD.)

Attach keyboard, display and ethernet to server. Mouse is not required.
Whichever ethernet you attach will become the factory interface, it's a good
idea to mark this for future reference. The install network must supply DHCP
and internet access. 

Install Debian:

    Boot the server from the prepared USB stick (or CD/DVD). This may require
    entering BIOS and selecting the boot device. 

    When the Debian install menu appears, press down arrow and select
    "Install".  Do not select "Graphical Install". 

    Select the default for language, country, keymap, and network.

    Set hostname to "factory". 

    Set domain name to "localdomain".

    Set a root password. Password strength is not super important since the
    only access to the system is via ssh key.  

    Leave the full name for new user blank.

    Set the username to "factory". Again, the password strength is not
    important, just using "factory" is acceptable. 
    
    Set the default time zone (it will be changed to UCT later).

    If the hard disk has an existing non-UEFI bootloader you will be asked if
    you want to continue to use it. You do not.

    Select partitioning method "Guided - use entire disk"

    Select the hard drive to be partitioned (probably "sda", but this may be
    different if hardware raid is enabled).

    Select "All files in one paritition".

    Select "Write changes to disk".

    You will be informed that the hard drive is about to be "destroyed" with
    three new partitions. Select "Yes".

    Wait several minutes while the base system is installed.

    Select "United States".
    
    Select "ftp.us.debian.org". 

    Enter proxy information if necessary, but note the proxy will need to be
    disabled once the server is installed in the factory.

    Wait several more minutes.

    When asked about "popularity-contest", select "No".

    When prompted for "Software selection" make sure only "SSH server" and
    "standard system utilities" are starred, then press tab, enter. A desktop
    environment must not be selected.

    Wait several more minutes.

    Finally the "Installation complete" screen will appear. Remove install
    media and hit enter.

The system will reboot. When the "factory login:" prompt appears, log in as
"factory":

First become root:

    > su - (enter the root password)

(Note the use of '>' in this document indicates a command to be entered.)

Check network interfaces:    
    
    > ip a

This should list two interfaces (besides "lo"). The inteface names are
hardware-specific, for example "eno1" and "eno2". One of the interfaces will
Have an "inet" address which was assigned by DHCP, this is one you plugged
ethernet cable into, and becomes the factory interface.  The other will not
have an address, this is the DUT interface. 

Make a note of the interface names and the current IP address.

(At this point you may find it easiesr to proceed after ssh'ing to the factory
server rather than continue to use the console).

Install git and download the factserv repo:

    > apt install -y git
    > git clone https://github.com/glitchub/factserv

Edit the install configuration script:
    
    > cd factserv/server
    > nano install.cfg (or vi, at your discretion)

Review the install configuration parameters, you may need to alter
"factory_interface" and "dut_interface" to reflect the results of 'ip a'
performed above, you will certainly want to change "organization".

Once the configuration is complete, run the installer:

    > ./install.sh

This will generate quite a bit of output, finally ending with "Install
complete". If you are asked any questions, type or select "Yes".

Reboot the system.
    
    > reboot

After reboot, note the IP address of both interfaces appear on the login
screen.

On your workstation, use the Firefox browser to browse to https://ip.ad.re.ss
and you'll get a certificate error. Add an exception to access the "Factory
Server" page. (Other browsers may also be used, but it's more difficult to
configure them for self-signed certificate).

To use ssh, copy the file server/insecure_factory_rsa_id to your workstation
~/.ssh directory, and chmod 600. Specify it as follows:

    you@yourpc$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/insecure_factory_rsa_id factory@ip.ad.re.ss

The ssh key passphase is "insecure".

################################### NOTE ###################################   

This process installs insecure ssh and ssl keys by default, to allow
preliminary configuration and testing. They are insecure because they are
published in this repo!

Before deploying the server to the factory, production keys must be installed.

The production keys are HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL and secure practices must be used
when handling them.

All production servers use the same ssl key. They can use different ssh keys,
although this may become a key management issue.

Key generation process is not in scope of this document.
